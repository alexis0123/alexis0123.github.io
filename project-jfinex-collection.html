      <p class="text-lg text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        The JFINEX Collection System is an Android app I built to simplify student payment collection. 
        Officers can record payments offline, automatically tally amounts by category, and export data 
        to the admin system for reports. Let me walk you through how to use this app from settingup a collection, 
        loading the setup to other officers with collection app, recoeding and tracking of receipts, to exporting 
        data to csv for deeper analysis and other use cases.

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-400">
          The student list, stored in a CSV file, is required for easier querying.
          This is the first requirement when creating a setup. Each setup must contain 
          at least one field, and if that field includes categories, it must have at 
          least two categories.Afterward, the admin should load the same setup to be 
          distributed to other officers, ensuring consistency for matching collections 
          later.

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-400">
          The setup is first loaded from the admin, where field options are defined. From this setup, you can 
          begin recording student collections, adding students, and preparing tallies to submit back to the admin.
          <br><br>
          To void a receipt, you must re-enter the student’s name. All voided receipts are recorded in the 
          activity log to ensure proper tracking of data flow and officer actions. Likewise, when new students 
          are added, the activity log also reflects these entries along with the officer’s name.
          <br><br>
          Once a tally is exported to a JSON file, all related activities are marked as completed and are no longer counted as 
          “new.” Only new receipt entries recorded after the export will be included in the next tally. All data 
          is stored in the JSON file, which can then be imported back into the admin system.
          <br><br>
          After a tally import, the activities are reflected in the system and can be used for data management, reporting, and other purposes.

        <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-200">Uses Xor Encryption</h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-400">
          To keep student and payment data secure, I added a simple encryption system using a custom XOR 
          function. Before storing sensitive information in JSON files such as tally and config 
          where all receipt numbers are stored, the app transforms the data 
          into a scrambled format using a secret key. This ensures that if someone accesses the files outside 
          the app, they won’t be able to read or tamper with the information.
          <br><br>
          The encryption works by taking each character of the data and combining it with a corresponding 
          character from the key using a bitwise XOR operation. The result is then encoded in Base64 for storage. 
          Later, the app can reverse the process using the same key to recover the original data. In simple 
          terms, it’s like locking the data in a secure box that only the app can open, keeping student records 
          and receipts protected while still allowing smooth offline use and export/import workflows.
